# NLP Spam Detection App
This app is a simple tool to classify text data as either spam or not spam (also known as "ham"). It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text and make a prediction.

## How to use the app
To use the app, simply enter the text that you want to classify into the input field and click the "Classify" button. The app will then analyze the text and provide a prediction of whether it is spam or ham.

## How the app works
The app uses a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of spam and ham text messages. The model has learned to recognize patterns and features that are characteristic of spam messages, and it uses this knowledge to make a prediction when given new text data.

## Limitations
It's important to note that the app is not perfect and may not always provide an accurate prediction. There are many factors that can influence the accuracy of the model, including the quality and size of the training data, the complexity of the model, and the specific characteristics of the text being analyzed.
